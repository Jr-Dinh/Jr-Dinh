- 👋 Hi, I’m @Jr-Dinh
- 👀 I’m interested in ... this "new to me" data analytics universe that I am currently taking with Coursera...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... I just learned about an online presence in GitHub
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... Anything worth working with others on right now. I am still new so I am not worth much to you all right now.
- 📫 How to reach me ... when I am ready I'll reveal this information but I am sure GitHub allows people to PM each other.
